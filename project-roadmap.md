## Stage 0

* Scanning in/digitization of all documents
* Analysis of MOL 940's syntax

## Stage 1

* Implementation of a minimally functional MOL 940 emulator using available documentation and existing source code
* Use of said minimally functional MOL 940 emulator to compile/execute simple sample program

## Stage 2

* Implementation of a more fully function MOL 940 emulator
* Use of said emulator to compile/execute UTILTY (core) overlay of NLS (which, to my understanding, holds various important low-level procedures)
* Recreation/restoration of all other missing but necessary code/constants for the UTILTY overlay

## Stage 3

* Implementation of a completely function MOL 940 emulator, with additional features
* Use of said emulator to compile/execute all known existing NLS overlay source code, as of December 1, 1969
* Recreation/restoration of all other missing but necessary code/constants/overlays for NLS
* Simulation of other aspects of the NLS, e.g. the display, input methods (chords, keyboard, mouse, etc.), etc.
